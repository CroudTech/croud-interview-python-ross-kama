Popularity is growing! and so should the offers  :D
It's time to think about growth.
Our marketing teams wants to experiment with new offer types and we should do our best to support them.

We are going to sell a new item E.
Normally E costs 40, but if you buy 2 of Es you will get B free.
How cool is that ? Multi-priced items also seemed to work well so we should have more of these.

Our price table and offers: 
+------+-------+------------------------+
| Item | Price | Special offers         |
+------+-------+------------------------+
| A    | 50    | 3A for 130, 5A for 200 |
| B    | 30    | 2B for 45              |
| C    | 20    |                        |
| D    | 15    |                        |
| E    | 40    | 2E get one B free      |
+------+-------+------------------------+

We have identified that customers may get different discount values
depending on the order in which offers are applied in on their basket.

To address this we have decided to introduce a new policy:
- Always maximize the discount value for the customer
